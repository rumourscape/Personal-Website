    <p>At the dawn of the year 2009, a mysterious figure calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto released a software into 
       the wild that spawned 'digits' out of thin air. These digits or 'coins' at the time were only seen as a 
       Proof-of-Concept of Blockchain technology and saw little interest. Surprisingly, crypto-technology enthusiasts 
       started competing to 'mine' these coins which yet still had little value, if any. 
       <br><br>
       Cut to 12 years later, these digital coins now are worth tens of thousands of dollars and still rising. 
       They are not a commodity nor a tangible object with intrinsic value. Their value solely lies in the eyes of the 
       believers. These believers like me find the value not because a Super-powerful institution claims it does but 
       rather because the maths and the code that it relies on is accurate and incontrovertible.
      <br><br>
       Bitcoin is not a currency for the exchange of small goods. Rather it is a store of absolute value. Much like
       gold but even more rarer, secure and valuable. Honestly, the Government of India's intentions to inhibit 
       the use of decentralized cryptocurrencies is a move towards a financial dark age. In fact, no government in the 
       world has been able to comprehensively limit it. The best move instead is to embrace this technology and 
       invest in its promise. Individuals and Institutions of India need to actively consider and diversify themselves 
       into this modern asset. American and European institutions have already woken up. Tesla along with Elon Musk 
       has invested about $1.5 Billion in Bitcoin.<br><br> And this is just the beginning.   </p>
